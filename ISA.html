<h1>ISA and MESSES<a class="headerlink" href="#isa-and-messes" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>Investigation/Study/Assay (ISA) is a format developed as a general purpose framework to
collect and communicate complex metadata. It is a format utilized by several repositories
for data submission. This page will try to describe some of the details of the JSON version
of the format and some of the issues in converting from the MESSES Experiment Description
Specification (EDS) to ISA-JSON.</p>

<h2>Problems To Be Solved<a class="headerlink" href="#problems-to-be-solved" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>As the EDS and conversion directives are now there are some issues with being able to go from
the EDS to ISA-JSON. I will try to describe them here and provide possible solutions.</p>
<section id="flattening-data">
<h3>Flattening Data<a class="headerlink" href="#flattening-data" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Overall most of the problems with converting the EDS to ISA-JSON is an issue of how
to flatten the ISA content to fit into the EDS. I will illustrate with an example.
The EDS does not have a specific place for the people involved in a project or study.
There are only fields for PI information in projects and studies. ISA-JSON allows for
individual people to be described under investigation and study as arrays of people
objects, and these people objects can have more than 1 layer of nesting. There is also
a field in process objects called “performer” that is a reference to a person.</p>
<p>This actually illustrates a recurring problem with some other fields as well, and I
have a couple of possible solutions. The first somewhat obvious solution is to add a
people table to the MESSES EDS.</p>
<p>The second solution is to choose a prefix to add to fields
in study and project that will indicate they are fields for a person. For instance,
a field like “person1_firstname” would indicate that this is a field for a person’s
firstname and the numerical part would be used to create separate objects for each
person. One issue with this is that people have more than 1 nesting, so you would need
multiple prefixes. For instance, a person can have multiple roles, so you would need
fields named like “person1_role1_termsource”. A person’s role can have “comments”, which
are an object, so you would also need something like “person1_role1_comment1_value”.
Some other objects have even more levels of nesting, so adding prefixes might be a solution
that we limit to 1 prefix. It is a good solution for something like the measurementType
field of an assay since it is a single object and not an array of them. New conversion
directive behavior would have to be implemented to support this.</p>
<p>Another “solution” would be to simply limit some of the arrays to 1 element. For instance,
instead of supporting a list of comments we only support being able to have 1 comment so
that there is only 1 set of fields for the single allowable comment.</p>
<p>Objects that share this issue:
people
publications
ontologyReferences
components
parameters
otherMaterials
characteristics</p>
</section>
<section id="subject-sample">
<h3>Subject/Sample<a class="headerlink" href="#subject-sample" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Sample’s can have multiple parents in ISA, but not in the EDS. It would be pretty
easy to fix this by making parent_id a list field. Subjects are called sources in ISA.</p>
</section>
<section id="factors">
<h3>Factors<a class="headerlink" href="#factors" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Factor values are put on samples in ISA, not subjects like in the EDS. We can either require
factor values to be on samples for ISA specific submissions, or create a custom conversion directive
that propagates factors through the subject/sample inheritance.</p>
</section>
<section id="data-files">
<h3>Data Files<a class="headerlink" href="#data-files" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Files have to be individual objects in ISA whereas we have them in a list. The conversion
directives have to be expanded to be able to create multiple objects from a single record.
Currently, directives are expected to make 1 per table record and changing this will
be a pretty significant change in the code.</p>
</section>
<section id="other-materials">
<h3>Other Materials<a class="headerlink" href="#other-materials" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>otherMaterials are used as a generic structure to describe materials consumed or
produced during an experimental workflow. It is hard to discern exactly what they
mean though because the “type” field can only be “Extract Name” or “Labeled Extract
Name”. An example name from their example data sets is “labeledextract-NZ_2hrs_Vehicle_Sample_2_Labelled”.
This also has a characteristic label of “biotin”. I don’t think we have a place
for something like this in the EDS. Based on where it is in ISA I think they
would maybe be part of a protocol in the EDS, but it would face the nesting problem
described above in Flattening Data.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="conversion-directive-improvements">
<h2>Conversion Directive Improvements<a class="headerlink" href="#conversion-directive-improvements" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>There are a few improvements to the conversion directives that I think will help
us deal with some of the problems in converting ISA.</p>
<section id="nested-directives">
<h3>Nested Directives<a class="headerlink" href="#nested-directives" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>A directive being able to call another one to fill in some values would be helpful.
The current directives only have the ability to create a dictionary or a matrix with
no nesting. Nesting directives would allow for creating a nested output. There would
need to be some changes to accommodate this.</p>
<p>One is that we need to reserve a syntax for
specifying a nested directive. I think starting with a forward slash is a good way
to indicate that you need to go to another directive, but we also need a syntax so
we know not to compute a nested directive on its own. I think using the percent sign
like we do for attributes could do this. For example, “/new_table%nested_directive”
would indicate to go and compute the “new_table%nested_directive” directive to fill
in the value, and the “%” would indicate when looping over the directives and computing
them to skip that one because it is nested somewhere else. This sort of combines
the idea of a JSON Pointer (forward slash) and field attributes.</p>
<p>Another would be that we need to add at least 2 new “value_types” to the directives
so the return values make sense. “section_matrix” and “section_str” would indicate
that the entire section or table will be the value of the directive. It is similar
to the “section” value_type but would return a matrix or string instead of relying
on computed Python code.</p>
<p>I have included an example below illustrating what a nested directive could look like.</p>

<h3>Passing Context<a class="headerlink" href="#passing-context" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>If we allow for nested directives then we are also likely to need to be able to
pass context from the calling directive. Directives inherently start from the context
of the entire input JSON and we use keywords like “table”, “test”, and “record_id” to
get them to the correct context needed to create the new record(s). If we do nested
directives then it is likely that the nested directive will need some information
from the calling directive in order to set up its context correctly. I have 2 ideas
for ways to do this.</p>
<p>The first is what I am going to call “caret syntax”. Basically, when a nested directive
is called it is going to have access to the fields of the record that called it by
using the “^” character. Anywhere a field value could be, if “^” is in front then it
will mean to use the field value of that name from the calling record. In the example
below the nested directive would use the calling record’s “id” field (a study record) to
filter out factors that don’t have that study’s id in their “study.id” field.</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">&quot;studies%factors&quot;: {</span>
<span class="go">    &quot;no_id_needed&quot;: {</span>
<span class="go">        &quot;value_type&quot;: &quot;section_matrix&quot;,</span>
<span class="go">        &quot;required&quot;: &quot;True&quot;,</span>
<span class="go">        &quot;test&quot;: &quot;study.id=^id&quot;,</span>
<span class="go">        &quot;headers&quot;: [</span>
<span class="go">          &quot;\&quot;@id\&quot;=\&quot;#factor/\&quot;id&quot;,</span>
<span class="go">          &quot;\&quot;factorName\&quot;=id&quot;,</span>
<span class="go">          &quot;\&quot;factorType\&quot;=/studies%factor%type&quot;,</span>
<span class="go">          &quot;\&quot;comments\&quot;=/studies%factors%comments&quot;</span>
<span class="go">        ],</span>
<span class="go">        &quot;table&quot;: &quot;factor&quot;</span>
<span class="go">        }</span>
<span class="go">    }</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The second way I think we can pass context is to allow arguments to be passed with
nested directives that can be used to fill in values. These could go anywhere, not
just as field values, and would be replaced with regex substitutions before the
directive was evaluated. We would need a reserved syntax though. Something like
“ARG1”, “ARG2”, etc. to indicate where to replace with the actual values passed in.
I have an example below.</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">&quot;new_table&quot;: {</span>
<span class="go">     &quot;new_field&quot;: {</span>
<span class="go">         &quot;value_type&quot;: &quot;matrix&quot;,</span>
<span class="go">         &quot;headers&quot;: [</span>
<span class="go">           &quot;\&quot;field1\&quot;=value1&quot;,</span>
<span class="go">           &quot;\&quot;field2\&quot;=value2&quot;,</span>
<span class="go">           &quot;\&quot;field3\&quot;=/new_table%nested_directive value3 value4&quot;</span>
<span class="go">         ],</span>
<span class="go">         &quot;table&quot;: &quot;factor&quot;</span>
<span class="go">         }</span>
<span class="go">     }</span>

<span class="go">&quot;new_table%nested_directive&quot;: {</span>
<span class="go">     &quot;no_id_needed&quot;: {</span>
<span class="go">         &quot;value_type&quot;: &quot;section_matrix&quot;,</span>
<span class="go">         &quot;headers&quot;: [</span>
<span class="go">           &quot;\&quot;field4\&quot;=ARG1&quot;,</span>
<span class="go">           &quot;\&quot;ARG2\&quot;=value5&quot;,</span>
<span class="go">           &quot;\&quot;field6\&quot;=value6&quot;</span>
<span class="go">         ],</span>
<span class="go">         &quot;table&quot;: &quot;factor&quot;</span>
<span class="go">         }</span>
<span class="go">     }</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>I don’t think either of these would be too difficult to implement in the code.</p>
</section>
<section id="concatenate-literal-and-field-values">
<h3>Concatenate Literal and Field Values<a class="headerlink" href="#concatenate-literal-and-field-values" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>This is needed for “&#64;id” fields which need to be a unique ID. They have a known
literal part depending on what object you are making, “#sample/” for instance, and
a unique part that can be created by combining fields or using a single field. I
feel like the best way to do this is to copy one of Python’s syntaxes. Either allow
plus signs (+) to indicate concatenation or use f strings. Ex. ‘”#sample/” + id’ or
‘f”sample/{id}”’. The plus sign is probably easier to implement.</p>
<p>I don’t think this would be too difficult to implement in the code.</p>

<section id="field-collate">
<h3>Field Collate<a class="headerlink" href="#field-collate" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>This may be necessary to handle some of the flattening I mentioned in Flattening Data.
Basically, we would add a keyword like “field_collate” that would indicate this
directive is creating multiple new records from the fields of a single old record,
as opposed to one new record for one old record as is typical. The headers would
then have to have at least one regex to collate the fields with. An example is below.</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">&quot;new_table&quot;:{</span>
<span class="go">    &quot;Data&quot;: {</span>
<span class="go">      &quot;required&quot;: &quot;True&quot;,</span>
<span class="go">      &quot;field_collate&quot;: &quot;True&quot;,</span>
<span class="go">      &quot;table&quot;: &quot;factor&quot;,</span>
<span class="go">      &quot;test&quot;: &quot;id=^id&quot;,</span>
<span class="go">      &quot;headers&quot;: [</span>
<span class="go">          &quot;\&quot;name\&quot;=r\&quot;comment(.*)_name\&quot;&quot;</span>
<span class="go">          &quot;\&quot;value\&quot;=r\&quot;comment(.*)_value\&quot;&quot;</span>
<span class="go">          ],</span>
<span class="go">      &quot;id&quot;: &quot;Data&quot;,</span>
<span class="go">      &quot;value_type&quot;: &quot;matrix&quot;</span>
<span class="go">    }</span>
<span class="go">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You can see that the headers have regexes for the values. The group would indicate
where to look for values to collate by. Let’s say a record had fields for “comment1_name”
and “comment2_name”. The regex “comment(.*)_name” would find 2 groups, “1” and “2”, to
collate by and would create a matrix with 2 objects, one for each group. I have illustrated
below.</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go"> record_fields =\</span>
<span class="go"> {</span>
<span class="go">   &quot;comment1_name&quot; : &quot;comment 1 name&quot;,</span>
<span class="go">   &quot;comment2_name&quot; : &quot;comment 2 name&quot;,</span>
<span class="go">   &quot;comment1_value&quot; : &quot;comment 1 value&quot;,</span>
<span class="go">   &quot;comment2_value&quot; : &quot;comment 2 value&quot;</span>
<span class="go"> }</span>

<span class="go"> output =\</span>
<span class="go"> [</span>
<span class="go">   {</span>
<span class="go">     &quot;name&quot;: &quot;comment 1 name&quot;,</span>
<span class="go">     &quot;value&quot;: &quot;comment 1 value&quot;</span>
<span class="go">   },</span>
<span class="go">   {</span>
<span class="go">     &quot;name&quot;: &quot;comment 2 name&quot;,</span>
<span class="go">     &quot;value&quot;: &quot;comment 2 value&quot;</span>
<span class="go">   }</span>
<span class="go">]</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This could be generalized to regexes with multiple groups by simply concatenating group
values together. For instance, a regex like “factor(.*)_comment(.*)_name” would just
concatenate the factor number and comment number together, and as long as the other
headers followed the same pattern the groups should match up.</p>
<p>As I mentioned in Flattening Data, this would be a fairly significant endeavor to
do I believe because of the inherent assumption of one record to one record in
the original conception of conversion directives.</p>
